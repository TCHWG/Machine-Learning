## Overview

Machine Learning (ML) is the core of AIRA, responsible for analyzing and evaluating piano performance based on user-uploaded audio. Our ML models are designed to classify mistakes related to note accuracy, rhythm timing, and chord structures, offering users real-time, detailed feedback to improve their musical performance. The workflow involves analyzing user-uploaded MIDI files and comparing them to ideal references. Mistakes are categorized into four types: 
1. Wrong Note
2. Missing Note
3. Extra Note
4. No Error

## Dataset
A custom synthetic dataset created using the [Twinkle Twinkle Little Star](https://musescore.com/juliathezhu/twinkle-twinkle-little-star-easy) to train the model and simulate piano mistake recognition. These methods are inspired by approaches outlined in the [paper](https://repositori.upf.edu/bitstream/handle/10230/60657/morsi_SMC_simu.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) and are applied to identify and correct musical mistakes.

## Model Architecture
Our model employs a **Feedforward Neural Network** (FNN) for piano mistake detection:
- **Input**: Extracted audio features (MFCC, chroma, tempo).
- **Hidden** Layers: Fully connected layers with ReLU activation.
- **Output**: Piano mistake predictions using softmax for classification.

## Results
The following metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance for each type of piano mistake:
- ROC AUC: Measures the ability of the model to distinguish between classes (mistake vs. no mistake) for each category.
- Precision-Recall AUC: Focuses on the trade-off between precision and recall, particularly useful for imbalanced datasets.
- Training and Validation Metrics: Tracks the model's accuracy, precision, and recall during training and validation.

### Performance Summary
| **Metric**          | **Training Value**  | **Validation Value**  |

| Accuracy            | 77.7%               | 72.4%                 |
| Precision           | 78.2%               | 73.6%                 |
| Recall              | 76.2%               | 72.5%                 |

### AUC Scores by Mistake Type
| **Mistake Type**    | **ROC AUC**  | **Precision-Recall AUC**  |
|:------------------  |:-------------|:--------------------------|
| Extra Note          | 91%          | 68%                       |
| Missing Note        | 92%          | 72%                       |
| Wrong Note          | 85%          | 70%                       |
| No Mistake          | 100%         | 100%                      |
